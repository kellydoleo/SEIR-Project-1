Hello! Welcome to Fenty Face Beauty Finder. 

I took it upon myself to redesign the "Shop Rihanna's Looks" tab of the fentybeauty.com website. If I were a software engineer for fentybeauty.com, these are some of the changes I would try to implement. 


Click on the images to see what products Rihanna used in her beauty looks. 

Issues 
• Resetting my page 
• Limiting on click 
• adding more images


Unsolved Problems
• API and product images take a while to load in comparison to the rest of the page 
• making the page responsive beyond the @media tags pixels 

Stretch Goals
• Create a search to up any Rihanna looks 
• Make my code more DRY
